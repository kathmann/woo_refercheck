A plugin for WooCommerce to enable filtering product display based on the referrer.

== Description ==
With this plugin you can ensure that certain products are only displayed when they are accessed via a (set of) specific referrer URLs. This way you can have special or discounted products available only when linked to from for example an affiliated site.

When active this plugin adds an extra text field to your WooCommerce products where you can add one or more referrer addresses. If the field is non-empty, the product will not be shown if the referrer does not match one of the filled in URLs.

Remember to set the visibility of your protected product to 'hidden', otherwise it will still show up in searches, category overviews etc.

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* WordPress 3.8 or greater
* WooCommerce 2.2.0 or greater
* PHP version 5.2.4 or greater
* MySQL version 5.0 or greater

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of WooCommerce ReferCheck, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “Woo ReferCheck” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our plugin you can view details about it such as the the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).
